# PDP Azure Backend

This folder contains the PDP backend services, implemented using Azure
[Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions/) and
[Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/).
To run this PDP functions locally, you will need:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) v20 or later
  * Latest NodeJS LTS version preferred.
* [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)
* [Azure Functions for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) (needed for debugging)
* [Azurite Storage Emulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=npm#install-azurite) or [Azurite Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Azurite.azurite) (needed for emulating Azure Blob Storage locally)
* [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (needed for deployment)

## Blob Storage

PDP stores encrypted provenance records and attachments in
[Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/).
The PDP functions can be configured to use either a production Azure Storage account or
an emulated Azure Storage service running locally.

### Local Azurite Storage Emulation

By default, PDP functions connect to emulated Azure Blob Storage running on localhost.
Before launching the Azure Function host, you need to start Azurite, the Azure Storage Emulator.

If you installed the Azurite VSCode extension, you can start the emulator via the `Azurite: Start`
VSCode command. Other commands of note are `Azurite: Close` to stop the emulator
and `Azurite: Clean` to remove all the data in the emulator. More details are available in the
[extension documentation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Azurite.azurite#visual-studio-code-extension).

If you installed Azurite on the command line, you can launch the emulator by creating
an empty directory and running `azurite --location <directory path>`. More details are
available in the [Azurite documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=npm%2Cblob-storage#run-azurite)

Note: Remember this directory. If you restart azurite in that directory, it will restore the
PDP devices produced in that directory. If you change the directory, it will look like a fresh
database.

### Production Azure Storage

To configure PDP functions to connect to a production Azure Storage account,
you need to configure the `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` and `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
values in the [local.settings.json](packages/backend/local.settings.json) file.
Instructions on retrieving the storage account name and key via the Azure portal or
command line tools are available via in the
[Azure Storage documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-cli#view-account-access-keys)

## Local Function Execution

Once azurite is running or the local.settings.json file has been updated with the
name and key for a production Azure Storage account, you can run and debug the function app

### VSCode Debugging

You can start the function host from inside of VSCode via the `start backend host` task
or the `Attach to Backend (Azure Functions)` debug launch configuration.

### Command Line Execution

You can start the funcion host on the command line by running `npm run start` from
the `packages/backend` repo directory. This NPM script will automatically build and run
 the PDP function app. The output of this script will look something like this:

```shell
>  npm run start

Function Runtime Version: 4.28.5.21962

Functions:
        getAttachment: [GET] http://localhost:7071/api/attachment/{deviceKey}/{attachmentID}
        getProvenance: [GET] http://localhost:7071/api/provenance/{deviceKey}
        postProvenance: [POST] http://localhost:7071/api/provenance/{deviceKey}
```

### Testing

The `packages/backend/test` repo folder contains a simple test to store or
retrieve provenance information via the PDP functions. This simple test is
invoked via the `npm run test` script. This script supports the following
command line options:

> Note, you need double dashes after `npm run test` in order to pass the
> command line options to the test script. i.e. `npm run test -- --put`

By default, the test script retrieves the provenance information for a
hardcoded device ID. You can change this to store sample provenance records
and attachments via the `--put/-p` command line option.

By default, the test script uses the PDP functions running locally on the
machine. You can change this to use the cloud deployed functions running
on `gosqasbe.azurewebsites.net` via the `--cloud/-c` command line option.

## Cloud Deployment

The following commands were used to deploy a test version of PDP functions
to a function app running on gosqasbe.azurewebsites.net.

> Note, these steps assume you've logged into your Azure account via `az login` and have [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed

``` shell
# set top level variables describing how/where function app is deployed
export LOCATION=westus2
export RG_NAME=rg-pdp-test
export STG_NAME=pdpteststorage
export FUNC_NAME=pdpazurefunc

# build function app locally for deployment
npm install --omit=dev
npm run build # assumes TS installed globally

# create backend storage for function app
az group create --name $RG_NAME --location $LOCATION
az storage account create --name $STG_NAME --location $LOCATION --resource-group $RG_NAME --sku Standard_LRS --allow-blob-public-access true

# set top level variable for storage account key
export STG_KEY=$(az storage account keys list  --account-name $STG_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME | jq '.[0].value')

# create and configure function app
az functionapp create --resource-group $RG_NAME  --consumption-plan-location $LOCATION --runtime node --runtime-version 20 --functions-version 4 --name $FUNC_NAME --storage-account gdtteststorage
az functionapp cors add --name $FUNC_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME --allowed-origins "*"
az functionapp config appsettings set --name $FUNC_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME --settings AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=$STG_NAME AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=$STG_KEY

# Deploy function app
