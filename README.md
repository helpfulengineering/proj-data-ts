# Project Data Platform

This is a work in progress. 

We are currently attempting to build a website to address broken supply chains, such as occur during natural disasters.
This is an attempt to build a website that allows makers and manufacturers to match demand for necessary articles which 
they can make. 
This matching of demand to supply is a fundamental human problem that could allow lives to be saved and 
distress relieved during the serial natuarl disaster that we face.

# Technology

At present, we are using Microsoft Azure to build a basic website.

Harry Pierson has explored an AI-based matching of tools and capabilities that are available to tools and capabilities 
which are are needed to make needed articles.

# Volunteers Needed

We need volunteers. Although we can use a wide variety of skills we need:
1. Programmers who can build a website with Azure
2. Front-end programmers who, using Nuxt/Vue/Boostrap, can implement visual components.

4. AI programmers who can use vector-matching a LLMs to build a robust matching algorithm.
